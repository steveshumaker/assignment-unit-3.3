    <ol type="I">
      <li>My main question is - would line 87 of part-supply.js be an acceptable solution (if the file didn't ask for a loop)?</li>
      <li>In JavaScript, is it more acceptable convention-wise to declare multiple variables on the same line, or should they be on separate lines?</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>For instance, if I had declared lines 76-78 in part-supply.js all on line 76 separated by a comma, is that acceptable?</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Thank you!</li>
